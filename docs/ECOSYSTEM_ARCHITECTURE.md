# Nexa Ecosystem Architecture

This document defines how Nexa exposes extension points without turning every
extension point into a plugin. It is the durable reference for capability
packages, connectors, skills, workflows, adapters, host surfaces, and future
native plugins.

## Current maturity

| Surface | Implemented boundary |
| --- | --- |
| Built-in capabilities | Registered tools and projected capability metadata |
| MCP connectors | External tool discovery/execution, approvals, and versioned user declarations |
| Skills | Reviewed import, registered-file reload, resource materialization, and invocation through existing tools |
| Themes | Validated declarative theme resources; no arbitrary JavaScript/CSS loader |
| Workflows | Built-in templates and durable workflow/schedule execution |
| Package discovery | Project capability manifest parsing/validation; not an executable package installer |
| Protocol exits | MCP export candidate metadata; ACP/A2A design metadata |
| Native plugins | Future isolation/host requirements; no general third-party code runtime |

The migration criteria below describe the intended progression. Their presence
does not mark every stage complete. Source authorities are
[ecosystem.rs](../crates/core/src/ecosystem.rs),
[capability manifests](../crates/core/src/capability_package.rs),
[built-in capability views](../crates/core/src/plugins.rs), and
[protocol maturity](../crates/core/src/protocol_exports.rs).

## Product Constraint

Nexa is a local-first desktop assistant for everyday knowledge and office work.
The ecosystem must preserve:

- local-first trust
- evidence-first answers
- consumer-grade usability
- practical desktop assistance
- reusable working sets

The default product experience should not require users to understand agent
internals. Advanced extension surfaces must sit behind clear trust and
installation boundaries.

## User-Owned Extension Home

Nexa has one global, user-owned declaration root:

```text
~/.nexa/
  capabilities/
  skills/
  themes/
  workflows/
  connectors/
    mcp.json
```

`NEXA_HOME` may override this location, but it must be an absolute path. This
root is for portable files users intentionally edit, review, back up, and share.
It is not a replacement for the operating-system app-data directory. The Tauri
identifier `com.nexa.desktop` and its app-data directory continue to own SQLite
state, caches, logs, indexes, downloaded runtimes, managed assets, approvals,
and other host internals. Credentials stay in host credential storage or are
referenced through environment variables; they must not be copied into
`.nexa` declarations.

The current live file-backed lanes are deliberately narrower than the directory
shape:

| Directory | Current behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `skills/<canonical-name>/` | Registered user skills use the Agent Skills canonical name for the folder and `SKILL.md` name while retaining an independent immutable database id and display name. Startup or explicit Reload imports valid edits while preserving database identity and enabled state. Rejected edits and unmodeled files remain untouched so the user can correct or keep them. Unknown folders are not activated until they pass the explicit import and security-review flow. Disabling a skill never deletes its files. |
| `themes/<theme-id>.json` | Declarative theme resources are schema-validated. Valid files override the same theme id in the persisted projection during hydration, including after registry initialization. After the first migration projection, deleting or renaming a tracked file removes its old theme identity. Rejected files remain untouched for correction. |
| `connectors/mcp.json` | Versioned MCP declarations are validated as a whole and projected into the runtime store. Invalid updates retain the last valid projection. |
| `capabilities/`, `workflows/` | Reserved package locations. Merely placing a file here does not grant permissions or activate native code; each package still needs a supported, trust-gated host path. |

On first startup after this layout is introduced, Nexa non-destructively copies
legacy user skill projections and `mcp-connectors.json` from app data when the
matching `.nexa` target does not already exist. Existing user-owned files always
win. After one complete later startup has read and materialized only the
canonical `.nexa` files, Nexa removes only legacy regular files whose canonical
copy still verifies. Modified, unknown, linked, conflicting, or in-use paths are
preserved with diagnostics. Bundled skill runtime assets live under
`<app-data>/runtimes/builtin-skills`; they are cache/runtime data, not a second
user skill source.

Workspace-local declarations remain separate under `<workspace>/.nexa`. They
are scoped to that registered source and its trust decision; they must not be
silently merged into the global user home. For example, project capability
discovery reads `<workspace>/.nexa/capabilities`, while global personal skills,
themes, and connectors use the user-owned root above.

## Core Rule

Do not use `plugin` as the default word for every extension.

Use the smallest ecosystem surface that provides the needed leverage:

1. Use a `Skill Package` for instructions, references, examples, and bundled
   helper scripts that are invoked by existing tools.
2. Use a `Connector` for external tools, services, and data sources. MCP is the
   first supported connector interface.
3. Use a `Workflow Package` for product-facing task templates that compose
   existing tools, skills, and connectors.
4. Use an `Adapter` for replaceable backends behind a stable host interface,
   such as model, image, search, or document runtimes.
5. Use a `Capability Package` for a coherent built-in or installable Nexa
   ability that owns tools, settings surfaces, workflows, checks, and tests.
6. Use a `Native Plugin` only when the extension needs code, hooks, or UI that
   cannot be represented by the safer surfaces above.

## Ecosystem Surfaces

| Surface | Purpose | External by default | Native code | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Core Platform | Required host runtime and trust model | No | Owned by Nexa | indexing, search, source scope, approvals, task runs, MCP client |
| Capability Package | Coherent Nexa ability with tools/settings/workflows | Built-in first, external later | Only after package host exists | Office Documents, File Workspace, Delegation |
| Connector | External service or process access | Yes | Out of process | MCP connectors, browser automation connector, SaaS tools |
| Skill Package | Portable working instructions and resources | Yes | No direct host code | research synthesis, document editing, persona design |
| Workflow Package | User-facing task template | Yes, after catalog format stabilizes | No | meeting summary, document compare, report brief |
| Adapter | Replaceable backend implementation | Usually internal first | Maybe, behind host interface | LLM provider, web search provider, image provider |
| Host Surface | Product shell | No | Host-owned | Desktop and paired phone browser; CLI/IDE/browser extensions are possible future hosts |
| Native Plugin | Last-resort isolated extension | Later | Yes, isolated | custom tool implementation, UI panel, hook bundle |

## Non-Plugin Surfaces

The following are not native plugins:

- MCP endpoints and processes: expose them to users as MCP connectors.
- Skills: they are skill packages.
- Workflow templates: they are workflow packages.
- Provider choices: they are adapters behind a capability package.
- Desktop and paired phone UI: they are host surfaces; future CLI, IDE, or
  browser-extension products would also belong in that category.
- Knowledge indexing, source scope, approval policy, task runs, and local
  persistence: they are core platform responsibilities.

## Built-In Package Classification

The current built-in manifest API is still named `PluginManifest` for
compatibility, but the manifests describe ecosystem surfaces. New work should
treat the name as legacy compatibility and avoid expanding "plugin" language in
user-facing docs.

| Manifest id | Surface | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `core-agent` | Core Platform | Orchestration, planning, and verification are host runtime responsibilities. |
| `knowledge-base` | Core Platform | Local evidence retrieval is a product pillar, not an optional plugin. |
| `office-documents` | Capability Package | Coherent document ability with tools, runtime checks, settings, and workflows. |
| `image-generation` | Adapter | Provider-backed generation behind a stable Nexa interface. |
| `web-research` | Adapter | Search/fetch providers cross the network through controlled backend adapters. |
| `file-workspace` | Capability Package | Source-scoped file inspection and edits are a coherent built-in ability. |
| `desktop-automation` | Host Surface | Desktop and shell actions depend on host permissions and approvals. |
| `agent-memory` | Capability Package | Playbooks, skills, personas, scratchpads, and feedback form a reusable context ability. |
| `agent-evaluation` | Core Platform | Quality previews protect the agent runtime itself. |
| `delegation` | Capability Package | Subagent work composes bounded agent tools and policies. |
| `mcp-connectors` | Connector | MCP exposes external server-defined tools behind approval policy. |

## Seven-Step Migration Path

### 1. Establish language and boundaries

Definition of done:

- `Capability Package`, `Connector`, `Skill Package`, `Workflow Package`,
  `Adapter`, `Host Surface`, and `Native Plugin` are defined in docs.
- Built-in manifests expose an ecosystem surface classification.
- Existing docs stop treating plugin as the umbrella term.

### 2. Manifest-driven built-in packages

Definition of done:

- Built-in package metadata has one source of truth.
- Tool-to-package mapping, settings surfaces, workflows, runtime checks, and
  provider catalogs are generated or validated from package metadata.
- Each built-in package has tests that verify every registered tool belongs to
  exactly one package surface.

### 3. MCP connectors as the first external lane

Definition of done:

- MCP connectors are documented separately from native plugins.
- Connector install/config/test/enable/disable lifecycle is explicit.
- Connector permissions are keyed by server and tool identity.
- The settings UI uses connector language for MCP.

### 4. Skill packages as the second external lane

Definition of done:

- Skill import/export documents the bundle structure, resource policy, and
  dependency model.
- Skill scanning blocks unsafe patterns before installation or proposal apply.
- Skills declare tool and connector dependencies without owning those tools.

### 5. Workflow packages for consumer-facing tasks

Definition of done:

- Workflow templates are documented as user-facing task packages.
- Workflows compose skills, tools, connectors, and approval requirements.
- The workflow catalog avoids internal agent jargon in user-facing text.

### 6. Protocol exits before native plugins

Definition of done:

- Nexa can expose selected local capabilities to other agents through a
  protocol surface, starting with MCP server mode.
- Protocol exports have explicit source-scope and approval policy.
- ACP or A2A is considered only after MCP server mode has stable tests.

### 7. Native plugin runtime last

Definition of done:

- Native plugins are process-isolated or otherwise constrained by a stable host
  interface.
- Native plugins cannot patch core files or register hidden high-risk behavior.
- Plugin packages declare permissions, hooks, settings, UI targets, tests, and
  compatibility versions.
- If a plugin needs a capability the host does not expose, the host interface is
  expanded generically rather than hard-coding that plugin into core.

## Capability Manifest Direction

The long-term package layout is:

```text
.nexa/capabilities/<package-id>/
  capability.yaml
  tools/
  skills/
  workflows/
  commands/
  hooks/
  tests/
```

The manifest should describe the package before implementation details:

```yaml
id: office-documents
name: Office Documents
surface: capability_package
description: Works with PPT, DOCX, XLSX, PDF, and HTML document flows.
version: 1
tools:
  - prepare_document_tools
  - get_document_info
  - compare_documents
settingsSurfaces:
  - office-runtime
workflows:
  - generate-presentation
runtimeChecks:
  - office-runtime
```

The package host should reject unknown high-risk permissions by default. The
manifest is a declaration; the runtime is still responsible for enforcing source
scope, approvals, network boundaries, and execution policy.

Project-local manifest discovery now reads:

```text
.nexa/capabilities/*/capability.yaml
```

Discovery parses YAML, validates the declared ecosystem surface and permissions,
and rejects native code unless the surface is `native_plugin`.

## External Contribution Guidance

For external contributors:

- Build an MCP connector when you need new external tools or service access.
- Build a skill package when you need reusable agent behavior over existing
  tools.
- Build a workflow package when you need a guided end-user task.
- Request an adapter interface when you need a new model, image, search, or
  document backend.
- Request native plugin support only when the above surfaces are insufficient.

This keeps the external path approachable while preserving the trust model that
the desktop assistant depends on.
