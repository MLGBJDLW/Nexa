# UX Quality Bar

## Goal

This document defines the front-end quality bar for Nexa as a consumer-facing desktop assistant.

Every major UI change should be judged against this bar before it ships.

## Product Experience Standard

The interface should feel:

- calm
- clear
- grounded
- useful
- predictable

It should not feel:

- noisy
- over-technical
- agent-debug-heavy
- visually fragmented
- like it was built only for programmers

## Core UX Rules

### 1. Show the user what matters, not what the model felt

Default UI should prioritize:

- what task is being worked on
- what sources are in scope
- what evidence supports the answer
- what the user can do next

Default UI should de-prioritize:

- raw chain-of-thought dumps
- verbose internal state labels
- agent implementation details that do not help user decisions

### 2. Streaming and completed states must match

- Streaming should not present a structure that collapses into a different structure after completion.
- Tool, phase, and reply order must remain stable.
- Users should feel that the run matured, not that it was reinterpreted.

### 3. Scope must always be visible

If the assistant is restricted by:

- source filters
- collection context
- file path constraints
- provider limits

the user should be able to see that clearly.

### 4. Evidence must be legible

- Answers should reveal support, not hide it.
- Evidence counts, citation chips, and confidence level should be easy to scan.
- “No evidence” and “weak evidence” should be explicit, never implied.

### 5. Consumer language first

Prefer:

- “working set” over “playbook state payload”
- “source scope” over “conversation_sources binding”
- “evidence strength” over “retrieval confidence artifact”

Internal naming can stay technical; user-facing copy should not.

### 6. Pages should form a workflow

Search, Collections, and Chat should feel like connected stages of one job:

- find
- review
- collect
- continue asking

The user should not need to mentally rebuild context after moving between pages.

### 7. Office and document tasks should feel natural

For non-technical users:

- document creation should feel intentional and guided
- file operations should feel safe
- generated outputs should look polished
- recovery and retry should be understandable

## Visual Quality Rules

### Layout

- Strong visual hierarchy
- Clear primary action
- Few simultaneous focal points
- No accidental duplication of the same context in multiple places

### Density

- Compact enough for desktop power use
- Spacious enough for ordinary users
- No “wall of pills” or “wall of debug panels” effect

### Motion

- Motion should explain state changes, not decorate them
- Streaming updates should feel continuous, not jumpy
- Expansion/collapse should preserve orientation

### Copy

- Short labels
- One meaning per chip/panel
- Status text should imply next action when relevant

## Review Checklist

Before shipping a UI change, check:

- Does the interface reduce or increase jargon?
- Is source scope obvious?
- Is evidence support visible?
- Do streaming and finished states feel like the same run?
- Can a non-technical user understand the page without prior explanation?
- Does the page help the user finish a real task faster?

If the answer to multiple questions is “no”, the design is not ready.
