# Ask Myself

> A local-first personal knowledge recall engine — rediscover what you already know.

<!-- TODO: Add hero screenshot here -->

## Overview

Ask Myself is a desktop application that turns your local files into a searchable, AI-augmented knowledge base. Point it at your folders — notes, PDFs, logs, spreadsheets — and it indexes everything locally. When you need to find something, describe it however you remember it: a half-recalled phrase, an approximate date, a vague topic. The app converges on the right content through hybrid search and an AI agent that cites every claim back to your documents.

Unlike cloud-based tools, everything stays on your machine. Indexing, embedding, and search run locally using SQLite and ONNX models. The AI agent connects to your choice of LLM provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, or local Ollama) but never sends your documents — only search-derived context. You control what gets indexed, what gets redacted, and what gets shared.

The core loop is: **ingest → index → search → cite → save**. Findings can be saved as Playbooks — curated evidence collections with steps, commands, and source citations that get stronger with use.

## Features

### 📂 Knowledge Management

- **Multi-source ingestion** — Add local folders as knowledge sources with include/exclude glob patterns
- **Supported formats** — Markdown, plain text, log files, PDF, DOCX, Excel (.xlsx), PowerPoint (.pptx), images
- **File watching** — Automatic re-indexing when files change (powered by `notify`)
- **Incremental updates** — Content-hashed chunks avoid redundant processing
- **OCR** — ONNX-based PaddleOCR (PP-OCRv4) extracts text from images and scanned PDFs, with optional LLM Vision fallback

### 🤖 AI-Powered Chat

- **Evidence-first agent** — Every answer is grounded in your documents with `[cite:CHUNK_ID]` citations
- **Multi-angle recall** — Vague queries trigger synonym expansion, cross-language search, and date-range inference
- **Tool-using agent** — 12 built-in tools the AI can call autonomously (see [Tools](#-tools-ai-agent) below)
- **Conversation history** — Persistent chat sessions with context carry-over
- **Configurable LLM providers** — OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, Ollama (local)
- **Custom system prompts** — Override agent behavior per conversation
- **Personalization** — Learns from feedback to surface preferred sources and adapt responses

### 🔍 Search

- **Hybrid search** — Combines SQLite FTS5 (BM25) with vector similarity for best-of-both retrieval
- **Local embeddings** — ONNX Runtime with multilingual models (MiniLM-L12 384d or E5-Base 768d), plus TF-IDF fallback
- **API embeddings** — Optional OpenAI-compatible embedding endpoints
- **Filters** — Source, file type, date range
- **Feedback loop** — Thumbs up/down/pin on results to improve future rankings

### 📋 Playbooks

- **Curated evidence collections** — Save search findings as reusable documents
- **Structured format** — Goal, prerequisites, steps, notes, and linked citations
- **Searchable** — Playbooks are first-class searchable entities
- **AI-generated** — Ask the agent to create playbooks from conversation findings

### 🔒 Privacy & Security

- **Local-first** — All data stored in a local SQLite database; no cloud requirement
- **Content redaction** — Regex-based rules to strip sensitive content before storage
- **Exclude patterns** — Glob rules to skip files/directories during ingestion
- **No telemetry** — Zero data collection

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) 1.75+
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 18+
- Tauri 2 system dependencies ([platform-specific guide](https://tauri.app/start/prerequisites/))

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/self-reply.git
cd self-reply

# Install frontend dependencies
cd apps/desktop
npm install
cd ../..
```

### Development

```bash
cd apps/desktop
npm run tauri dev
```

This starts the Vite dev server and launches the Tauri window with hot reload.

### Building

```bash
cd apps/desktop
npm run tauri build
```

Produces a platform-specific installer in `target/release/bundle/`.

## 🛠 Tools (AI Agent)

The agent has access to 12 tools it calls autonomously during conversations:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `search_knowledge_base` | Hybrid FTS + vector search across all indexed content |
| `retrieve_evidence` | Fetch exact chunk text by ID for citation |
| `get_chunk_context` | Get surrounding chunks when a result seems incomplete |
| `read_file` | Read full document content |
| `list_sources` | List configured knowledge sources |
| `list_documents` | List indexed documents with metadata |
| `list_dir` | Browse directory contents |
| `manage_playbook` | Create, update, and delete playbooks |
| `search_playbooks` | Search across saved playbooks |
| `write_note` | Save AI-generated summaries or syntheses |
| `edit_file` | Modify existing files or create new ones within sources |
| `fetch_url` | Fetch content from a URL shared by the user |

## 🌐 Supported Languages

The UI is available in 10 languages:

| Language | Code |
|----------|------|
| English | `en` |
| 简体中文 (Simplified Chinese) | `zh-CN` |
| 繁體中文 (Traditional Chinese) | `zh-TW` |

The AI agent also performs cross-language search — queries in one language will find content written in another.
